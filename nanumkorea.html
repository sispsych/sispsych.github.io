    Nanoom Korea (나눔 코리아) is a non-profit community service organization that tackles one of South Korea's most urgent issues: Senior poverty. By bringing together members of the community to aid senior citizens that live in poverty or have been abandoned by their families, Nanoom Korea not only saves lives but brings further awareness to the often forgotten problems of Korean society.
